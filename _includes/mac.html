  <li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
    <br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
    Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!
    <br>
    If you need a spreadsheet
    program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
    instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
      <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Mac
      should automatically be selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" <b>Download Version x.y.z</b>. You
      will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
      Your download should begin automatically.
      <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
      <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
      <li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
    </ul>

<p>
       
  <li><b>Text Editor</b>
    <br>When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell. 
    nano is a basic editor and the default that instructors use in the workshop.
    It should be pre-installed.
    Other editors that you can use are:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a>
      <li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>
    </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>The Bash Shell</b>
    <br>Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly. The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>). There is no need to install anything.
    
<p>

  <li><b>Git</b>
    <br><p>Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
    
    <p>You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
    for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.
      
    <p>You can install Git as follows:    
    <ul>
      <li>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
      <li>
    </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>OpenRefine</b>
    <br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
    that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
    Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
    You will need to download Google Refine and install it,
    and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
    an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
      page</a>
      <li>Click on <i>Mac kit</i> to download the install file
      <li>Open the downloaded .dmg file
      <li>Drag the icon in to the Applications folder
      <li>Double click on the icon and Google Refine will then open in your web browser.
      <li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.
    </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>R</b>
    <br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
    programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <a href=http://cran.r-project.org>CRAN</a> and click on <i>Download
      R for (Mac) OS X</i>
      <li>Select the .pkg file for the version of OS X that you have and the file
      will download.
      <li>Double click on the file that was downloaded and R will install
      <li>Go to the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Download page</a>
      <li>Under <i>Installers</i> select <b>RStudio <em>x.yy.zzz</em> - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)</b> to download it.
      <li>Once it's downloaded, double click the file to install it
      <li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
    </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>SQLite</b>
    <br>
    For this workshop we're going to use the Firefox SQLite Plugin. It works through
    the web browser Firefox.
    <ul>
      <li>If you don't already have Firefox installed <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>install Firefox</a>
      <li>Start Firefox
      <li>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/">plugin homepage</a>.
      <li> Click the "Add Now" button.
      <li> Click "Install Now" on the dialog that appears after the download completes.
      <li> Restart Firefox when prompted.
      <li> Select "SQLite Manager" from the "Tools" menu and it will open within Firefox
    </ul>

</ol>
