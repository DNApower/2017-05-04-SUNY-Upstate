Above are the raw counts for each indvidual sample, as they would be after copying them over from the cloud. These have been combined together into the file `full_expression_counts.raw.txt`. The important metadata for this dataset is stored in `full_expression_counts.metadata.txt`.

The raw data files and reasonable intermediates of the cloud-based analysis are available from figshare by visiting [https://figshare.com/s/ec43b22e2054b2557498](https://figshare.com/s/ec43b22e2054b2557498).
